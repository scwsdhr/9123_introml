    "Machine learning is a key tool for neuroscientists to understand how sensory and motor signals are encoded in the brain. In addition to improving our scientific understanding of neural phenomena, understanding neural encoding is critical for brain machine interfaces. In this lab, you will use linear regression with feature selection for performing some simple analysis on real neural signals. \n",

    "Before doing this lab, you should review the ideas in the [polynomial model selection demo](./polyfit.ipynb).  In addition to the concepts in that demo, you will learn to:\n",

    "* Formulate models of different complexities using heuristic model selection\n",

    "Neurons are the basic information processing units in the brain.  Neurons communicate with one another via *spikes* or *action potentials* which are brief events where voltage in the neuron rapidly rises then falls.  These spikes trigger the electro-chemical signals between one neuron and another.  In this experiment, the spikes were recorded from 196 neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1) of a monkey using an electrode array implanted onto the surface of a monkey's brain.  During the recording, the monkey performed several reaching tasks and the position and velocity of the hand was recorded as well.  \n",
